A cnc pendant to control grbl based cnc desktop based machines

I have a desktop cbeam cnc machine, running on grbl and controlled via universal gcode sender.
Ive grown tired of having to use the laptop just to move the machine to certian positions, especially seeing that the laptop is not located nearby.
So i have decided to make a pendant to control the machine so i can better control the machine before running a job
